### Heya! 👋

### About me 😎
My name is David, I'm 17 years old and I have a passion for programming and networking since I was 14.
In my free time I like to make cool projects or programs that may be helpful for people, as well as working out,
going out with friends or watch TV series.

- 🔨 Fixing bugs is my point of strength (Also patience 😁).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Rust.
- ⚡ Languages that I can speak: Italian, Spanish, Romanian, English and Portuguese.
